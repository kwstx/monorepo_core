# A2A Coordination Layer - API Service

This service provides a standalone, API-driven interface for Agent-to-Agent (A2A) coordination. It allows autonomous agents to negotiate, formalize contracts, validate policies, and settle outcomes without being tied to a specific agent framework or cloud provider.

## Key Features

- **Negotiation Engine**: State-machine based negotiation (Offer -> Counteroffer -> Acceptance -> Commitment).
- **Contract Management**: Immutable contract creation and lifecycle tracking.
- **Policy Validation**: Real-time checking of messages against economic, compliance, and governance rules.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Detection and resolution of resource overlaps or contradictory task scopes.
- **Settlement & Reputation**: Automated reward release, penalty application, and reputation updates.
- **Predictive Pairing & Coalitions**: Pre-negotiation recommendation engine that ranks optimal agent pairs/coalitions using historical outcomes, synergy metrics, and economic performance.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/contracts/:contractId`: Retrieve contract details.

### Validation

### Strategic Recommendations

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Service**:

   ```
   The service will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **API Documentation**:
   Refer to `docs/openapi_spec.yaml` for the full OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

## Compatibility

The API uses standard JSON payloads and is compatible with any agent framework (OpenAI Swarm, LangChain, Autogen, PydanticAI) as long as they can perform HTTP requests and wrap their communication in the `AgentCoordinationMessage` schema.
